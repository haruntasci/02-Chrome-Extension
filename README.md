## Hi there!👋🏻 
In this project, I created a Chrome Extension. ✈️
With this extension, users can save the current page link by just clicking the "SAVE TAB" button.
The user can also save a manually entered link by clicking the "SAVE INPUT" button.
When the user clicks the "DELETE ALL" button twice, all the data will be deleted.
